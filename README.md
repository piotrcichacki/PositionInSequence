Algorithms and Data Structures laboratory1

### Instructions
Write and use a function (iterative or recursive) which finds a given element in the monotonically increasing OR decreasing sequence of (signed) integers. The function should return the index of the found element, or −1 if it doesn’t exist in the sequence. <br/>
(Indices in the sequence should be counted starting from 0)

### Input
First line: m - number of test scenarios. <br/>
Next, for each test scenario, in consecutive lines:
<ul>
  <li>n - number of elements in the sequence</li>
  <li>the sequence itself (n numbers separated by spaces)</li>
  <li>p - number of elements to be found</li>
  <li>k0, ..., kp-1 - p elements to be found in the sequence.</li>
</ul>

### Output
One line for each of p elements to be found for each of n test scenarios: the index of the given element ki in the sequence, or -1 if ki was not found in the sequence.
